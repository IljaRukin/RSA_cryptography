# RSA_cryptography
iPython notebooks about mostly asymmetric cryptography. \
First there is a script to encrypt/decrypt messages by rearranging the characters in the message. \
All other notebooks build towards understanding nonsymmetric cryptography (encryption with public and private keys), namely Diffie-Hellman and RSA.
Before you understand this two algorithms, you have to know about:
- prime numbers
- euclids algorithm
- euler totient function and theorem
- modulo arithmetic
after that you will be able to understand:
- RSA
- Diffie Hellman

TODO:
- Extended Euclidean algorithm
- Chinese Reminder Theorem
- elliptic curve cryptographie
