    "### Diffie Hellman Algorithm\n",
    "used for shared key generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob use a prime number p and a generator g ($1<g<p$) to generate a cyclic group [1,p-1] by $g^a \\pmod p$. The shared key will be one of the elements in this group. It's crucial to choose a generator, wich generates a sufficient big group to avoid brute force attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "They choose their numbers a,b < n and compute element $g^{a \\cdot b} \\pmod p$ from this cyclic group, wich is the new shared key.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Algorithm works, since the order of exponentiation and modulo division does not change the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "(g^a \\mod p)^b \\pmod p &= ( \\underbrace{g \\cdot ... \\cdot g}_{\\text{a  elements}} \\pmod p ) \\cdot ( \\underbrace{g \\cdot ... \\cdot g}_{\\text{b  elements}} \\pmod p ) \\\\\n",
    "&= (g^b \\mod p)^a \\pmod p \\\\\n",
    "&= g^{(a \\cdot b)} \\pmod p\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The group has a maximum size of p-1, since zero can not occur ($g^a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$). If this maximum group-size is divisible by a prime q, than there are at least q generators, wich generate this group-size. Unfortunately p-1 is even, so there are also groups of size 2, but they are extremly improbable. Usually a \"safe\"-prime number p is used, wich in turn is composed out of a big prime q: p = 2*q + 1. This way a random generator is very likely to produce a big group-size.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler method is to stick to known primes and generators, wich are specified in some cryptographic protocols."
